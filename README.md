This program was created when I was a freshman in high school with the goal of creating an environment with which to experiment with evolution.



There is a simple command prompt for inspecting various properties:
- pause: freezes the program
- continue: resumes the program
- teleport: Sets all creature positions to current mouse coordinates
- average [property]: Calculates the average value for a property among all creatures and prints it in the environment console. This property must be a property of the class CornEater and must be a number.
- setpopulation [integer]: resets the population with the desired number of creatures
- focus [integer]: focuses on a creature at a specific index of the array in which all creatures are stored. This can also be done by clicking a creature.
- read [property]: Reads the desired property of the selected creature.
- clear: Clears console
- runfor [integer]: Runs the simulation within a for loop for the requested number of times. Not recommended.

Remember, there are plenty of useful logs in the JavaScript console as well.
Have fun!
